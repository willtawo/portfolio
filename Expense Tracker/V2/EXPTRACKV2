# Expense Tracker Readme

This is an Expense Tracker Python program that allows you to manage your expenses and budgets. It provides a command-line interface for various functions, including adding expenses, setting budgets, generating reports, and visualizing expense distributions. Here's how you can use it:

## Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed. You can install them using pip if you don't have them already.

    ```bash
    pip install matplotlib reportlab pandas graphviz
    ```

2. **Database Setup**: The program uses an SQLite database named `expense_tracker.db` to store expenses and budgets. The database and necessary tables will be created automatically when you run the program.

## Usage

Run the `expense_tracker1.py` program from your terminal:

```bash
python3 expense_tracker1.py

4. **View Expenses**: Display a list of all recorded expenses.

5. **Generate Report**: Generate an expense report, including total expenses for each category.

6. **Visualize Expense Distribution (Tree Diagram)**: Create a hierarchical tree diagram of expense distribution using Graphviz. This option may require additional dependencies to visualize the graph.

7. **Export Expense Report to PDF**: Export the expense report to a PDF file.

8. **Export Expense Report to Excel**: Export the expense report to an Excel file.
