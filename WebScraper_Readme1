# Web Scraping Script

This Python script is designed to scrape data from a website and search for specified keywords while also counting how many times each keyword appears on the webpage.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have Python installed on your system. You'll also need to install the following Python libraries if you haven't already:

- `requests`: To send HTTP GET requests.
- `beautifulsoup4` (Beautiful Soup): To parse HTML content.

You can install these libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4

Usage
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

Open the script file web_scraping.py in a text editor.

Edit the following variables to suit your needs:

url: Replace 'https://example.com/blog' with the URL of the website you want to scrape.

keywords: Modify the list of keywords you want to search for on the webpage.

Save your changes.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is located.

Run the script using the following command:

python web_scraping.py

The script will send an HTTP GET request to the specified URL, parse the webpage's HTML content, search for the keywords, and display how many times each keyword was found on the page.
